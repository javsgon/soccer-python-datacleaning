# Soccer Python Data Cleaning

## Calculate and visualize various measures
We start by knowing that the type_id column = 16 represents goals, and type_id 0 and 17 represent cards.

- Show the league's top scorers. (We are only interested in seeing the player's first name, last name, and the number of goals)
- Display the ranking of teams with the most cards. (We are only interested in seeing the team's name and the number of cards)
- Represent on the same soccer field, using different colors, the positions from which Karim Benzema and Lionel Messi have scored goals.
- Select all event data from the match between Atlético and Espanyol (3-1) on November 10, 2019.
- Show the information about the goals in the match, displaying only the player's name, the team, and the number of goals.
- Calculate the percentage of events that have occurred for both teams where x <= 17 (zone1), x > 17 and x <= 50 (zone2), x > 50 and x <= 83 (zone3), x > 83 (zone4).
- Extra: Complete all graphs with a title that corresponds to the information being shown.
- Extra: Calculate the average position of each Atlético de Madrid player on the field and plot it on the soccer field.
- Extra: Using all event dataset, create a bar chart indicating the goals scored by each 'real_position' type.
- Extra: Using all event dataset, create a bar chart showing the number of cards received by each 'real_position' type.
